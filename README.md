# Great year, bad Sharpe?
## A note on the joint distribution of performance and risk-adjusted return

Returns distributions are heavy-tailed across asset classes. 
In this note, I examine the implications of this stylized fact for the joint statistics of performance and risk-adjusted return. 
Using both synthetic and real data, I show that the Sharpe ratio does not increase monotonically with mean return: in a sample of price trajectories, the largest Sharpe ratios are associated with suboptimal performance; conversely, the best performance corresponds to Sharpe ratios near one. 
This counter-intuitive effect is due to asymptotic correlations between the sample mean and sample standard deviation of heavy-tailed variables. 
Together with its large sample nois, this ``great year, bad Sharpe'' property puts into question the widespread use of Sharpe ratios as gold standard of investment quality.
