  abstract = {Zero-determinant strategies are a new class of probabilistic and conditional strategies that are able to unilaterally set the expected payoff of an opponent in iterated plays of the Prisoner's Dilemma irrespective of the opponent's strategy (coercive strategies), or else to set the ratio between the player's and their opponent's expected payoff (extortionate strategies). Here we show that zero-determinant strategies are at most weakly dominant, are not evolutionarily stable, and will instead evolve into less coercive strategies. We show that zero-determinant strategies with an informational advantage over other players that allows them to recognize each other can be evolutionarily stable (and able to exploit other players). However, such an advantage is bound to be short-lived as opposing strategies evolve to counteract the recognition.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary game theory is a successful mathematical framework geared towards understanding the selective pressures that affect the evolution of the strategies of agents engaged in interactions with potential conflicts. While a mathematical treatment of the costs and benefits of decisions can predict the optimal strategy in simple settings, more realistic settings such as finite populations, non-vanishing mutations rates, stochastic decisions, communication between agents, and spatial interactions, require agent-based methods where each agent is modeled as an individual, carries its own genes that determine its decisions, and where the evolutionary outcome can only be ascertained by evolving the population of agents forward in time. While highlighting standard mathematical results, we compare those to agent-based methods that can go beyond the limitations of equations and simulate the complexity of heterogeneous populations and an ever-changing set of interactors. We conclude that agent-based methods can predict evolutionary outcomes where purely mathematical treatments cannot tread (for example in the weak selection--strong mutation limit), but that mathematics is crucial to validate the computational simulations.},

The first part, Chapters 1 to 6, provides a pedagogical introduction to the important Lie algebras so(3), so(2,1), so(4) and so(4,2) needed for the study of simple quantum systems such as the D-dimensional hydrogen atom and harmonic oscillator. This material is suitable for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students. Of particular importance is the use of so(2,1) in Chapter 4 as a spectrum generating algebra for several important systems such as the non-relativistic hydrogen atom and the relativistic Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations. This approach provides an interesting and important alternative to the usual textbook approach using series solutions of differential equations.},

This complex corresponds to the splicing intermediate before the exon ligation step. It reveals how the intron uses structurally unprecedented RNA motifs to select the 5{$\prime$}- and 3{$\prime$}-splice sites. The 5{$\prime$}-exon's 3{$\prime$}-OH is positioned for inline nucleophilic attack on the conformationally constrained scissile phosphate at the intron--3{$\prime$}-exon junction. Six phosphates from three disparate RNA strands converge to coordinate two metal ions that are asymmetrically positioned on opposing sides of the reactive phosphate. This structure represents the first splicing complex to include a complete intron, both exons and an organized active site occupied with metal ions.},

  abstract = {A central question in ecology is to understand the ecological processes that shape community structure. Niche-based theories have emphasized the important role played by competition for maintaining species diversity. Many of these insights have been derived using MacArthur's consumer resource model (MCRM) or its generalizations. Most theoretical work on the MCRM has focused on small ecosystems with a few species and resources. However theoretical insights derived from small ecosystems many not scale up to large ecosystems with many resources and species because large systems with many interacting components often display new emergent behaviors that cannot be understood or deduced from analyzing smaller systems. To address these shortcomings, we develop a statistical physics inspired cavity method to analyze MCRM when both the number of species and the number of resources is large. Unlike previous work in this limit, our theory addresses resource dynamics and resource depletion and demonstrates that species generically and consistently perturb their environments and significantly modify available ecological niches. We show how our cavity approach naturally generalizes niche theory to large ecosystems by accounting for the effect of collective phenomena on species invasion and ecological stability. Our theory suggests that such phenomena are a generic feature of large, natural ecosystems and must be taken into account when analyzing and interpreting community structure. It also highlights the important role that statistical-physics inspired approaches can play in furthering our understanding of ecology.}

  abstract = {Networks studied in many disciplines, including neuroscience and mathematical biology, have connectivity that may be stochastic about some underlying mean connectivity represented by a non-normal matrix. Furthermore, the stochasticity may not be independent and identically distributed (iid) across elements of the connectivity matrix. More generally, the problem of understanding the behavior of stochastic matrices with nontrivial mean structure and correlations arises in many settings. We address this by characterizing large random N{\texttimes}N matrices of the form A=M+LJR, where M,L, and R are arbitrary deterministic matrices and J is a random matrix of zero-mean iid elements. M can be non-normal, and L and R allow correlations that have separable dependence on row and column indices. We first provide a general formula for the eigenvalue density of A. For A non-normal, the eigenvalues do not suffice to specify the dynamics induced by A, so we also provide general formulas for the transient evolution of the magnitude of activity and frequency power spectrum in an N-dimensional linear dynamical system with a coupling matrix given by A. These quantities can also be thought of as characterizing the stability and the magnitude of the linear response of a nonlinear network to small perturbations about a fixed point. We derive these formulas and work them out analytically for some examples of M,L, and R motivated by neurobiological models. We also argue that the persistence as N{$\rightarrow$} of a finite number of randomly distributed outlying eigenvalues outside the support of the eigenvalue density of A, as previously observed, arises in regions of the complex plane {\textohm} where there are nonzero singular values of L-1(z1-M)R-1 (for z{\textohm}) that vanish as N{$\rightarrow$}. When such singular values do not exist and L and R are equal to the identity, there is a correspondence in the normalized Frobenius norm (but not in the operator norm) between the support of the spectrum of A for J of norm {$\sigma$} and the {$\sigma$} pseudospectrum of M.},

In particular, we show that in this phase the number of locally stable equilibria is exponential in the number of species. Upon further decreasing the demographic noise, we unveil the presence of a second transition like the so-called ``Gardner'' transition to a marginally stable phase similar to that observed in the jamming of amorphous materials. We confirm and complement our analytical results by numerical simulations. Furthermore, we extend their relevance by showing that they hold for other interacting random dynamical systems such as the random replicant model. Finally, we discuss their extension to the case of asymmetric couplings.},

Autocatalytic networks have been discovered in various chemistries, but we lack a general understanding of how network topology controls the Darwinian properties of variation, differential reproduction, and heredity, which are mediated by the chemical composition. Using barcoded sequencing and droplet microfluidics, we establish a landscape of thousands of networks of RNAs that catalyze their own formation from fragments, and derive relationships between network topology and chemical composition. We find that strong variations arise from catalytic innovations perturbing weakly connected networks, and that growth increases with global connectivity. These rules imply trade-offs between reproduction and variation, and between compositional persistence and variation along trajectories of network complexification. Overall, connectivity in reaction networks provides a lever to balance variation (to explore chemical states) with reproduction and heredity (persistence being necessary for selection to act), as required for chemical evolution.},

  abstract = {The computation of observables in general interacting theories, be them quantum mechanical, field, gauge or string theories, is a non-trivial problem which in many cases can only be addressed by resorting to perturbative methods. In most physically interesting problems these perturbative expansions result in asymptotic series with zero radius of convergence. These asymptotic series then require the use of resurgence and transseries in order for the associated observables to become nonperturbatively well-defined. Resurgence encodes the complete largeorder asymptotic behaviour of the coefficients from a perturbative expansion, generically in terms of (multi) instanton sectors and for each problem in terms of its Stokes constants. Some observables arise from linear problems, and have a finite number of instanton sectors and associated Stokes constants; some other observables arise from nonlinear problems, and have an infinite number of instanton sectors and Stokes constants. By means of two very explicit examples, and with emphasis on a pedagogical style of presentation, this work aims at serving as a primer on the aforementioned resurgent, large-order asymptotics of general perturbative expansions. This includes discussions of transseries, Stokes phenomena, generalized steepest-descent methods, Borel transforms, nonlinear resonance, and alien calculus. Furthermore, resurgent properties of transseries---usually described mathematically via alien calculus---are recast in equivalent physical languages: either a ``statistical mechanical'' language, as motions in chains and lattices; or a ``conformal field theoretical'' language, with underlying Virasoro-like algebraic structures.},

  abstract = {A mathematical analysis of the evolution of a large population under the weak-mutation limit shows that such a population would spend most of the time in stasis in the vicinity of saddle points on the fitness landscape. The periods of stasis are punctuated by fast transitions, in lnNe/s time (Ne, effective population size; s, selection coefficient of a mutation), when a new beneficial mutation is fixed in the evolving population, which accordingly moves to a different saddle, or on much rarer occasions from a saddle to a local peak. Phenomenologically, this mode of evolution of a large population resembles punctuated equilibrium (PE) whereby phenotypic changes occur in rapid bursts that are separated by much longer intervals of stasis during which mutations accumulate but the phenotype does not change substantially. Theoretically, PE has been linked to self-organized criticality (SOC), a model in which the size of ``avalanches'' in an evolving system is power-law-distributed, resulting in increasing rarity of major events. Here we show, however, that a PE-like evolutionary regime is the default for a very simple model of an evolving population that does not rely on SOC or any other special conditions.},

  abstract = {The stability of complex ecological networks depends both on the interactions between species and the direct effects of the species on themselves. These self-effects are known as 'self-regulation' when an increase in a species' abundance decreases its per-capita growth rate. Sources of self-regulation include intraspecific interference, cannibalism, time-scale separation between consumers and their resources, spatial heterogeneity and nonlinear functional responses coupling predators with their prey. The influence of self-regulation on network stability is understudied and in addition, the empirical estimation of self-effects poses a formidable challenge. Here, we show that empirical food web structures cannot be stabilized unless the majority of species exhibit substantially strong self-regulation. We also derive an analytical formula predicting the effect of self-regulation on network stability with high accuracy and show that even for random networks, as well as networks with a cascade structure, stability requires negative self-effects for a large proportion of species. These results suggest that the aforementioned potential mechanisms of self-regulation are probably more important in contributing to the stability of observed ecological networks than was previously thought.},

  abstract = {Predation often deviates from the law of mass action: many micro- and meso-scale experiments have shown that consumption saturates with resource abundance, and decreases due to interference between consumers. But does this observation hold at macro-ecological scales, spanning many species and orders of magnitude in biomass? If so, what are its consequences for large-scale ecological patterns and dynamics?. We perform a meta-analysis of predator--prey pairs of mammals, birds and reptiles, and show that total predation rates appear to increase, not as the product of predator and prey densities following the Lotka--Volterra (mass action) model, but rather as the square root of that product. This suggests a phenomenological power-law expression of the effective cross-ecosystem predation rate. We discuss whether the same power-law may hold dynamically within an ecosystem, and assuming that it does, we explore its consequences in a simple food chain model. The empirical exponents fall close to the boundary between regimes of donor and consumer limitation. Exponents on this boundary are singular in multiple ways. First, they maximize predator abundance and some stability metrics. Second, they create proportionality relations between biomass and productivity, both within and between trophic levels. These intuitive relations do not hold in general in mass action models, yet they are widely observed empirically. These results provide evidence of mechanisms limiting predation across multiple ecological scales. Some of this evidence was previously associated with donor control, but we show that it supports a wider range of possibilities, including forms of consumer control. As limiting consumption counter-intuitively allows larger populations, it is worthwhile to reconsider whether the observed predation rates arise from microscopic mechanisms, or could hint at selective pressure at the population level.},

  abstract = {What determines the genetic contribution that an individual makes to future generations? With biparental reproduction, each individual leaves a ``pedigree'' of descendants, determined by the biparental relationships in the population. The pedigree of an individual constrains the lines of descent of each of its genes. An individual's reproductive value is the expected number of copies of each of its genes that is passed on to distant generations conditional on its pedigree. For the simplest model of biparental reproduction (analogous to the Wright--Fisher model), an individual's reproductive value is determined within {$\sim$}10 generations, independent of population size. Partial selfing and subdivision do not greatly slow this convergence. Our central result is that the probability that a gene will survive is proportional to the reproductive value of the individual that carries it and that, conditional on survival, after a few tens of generations, the distribution of the number of surviving copies is the same for all individuals, whatever their reproductive value. These results can be generalized to the joint distribution of surviving blocks of the ancestral genome. Selection on unlinked loci in the genetic background may greatly increase the variance in reproductive value, but the above results nevertheless still hold. The almost linear relationship between survival probability and reproductive value also holds for weakly favored alleles. Thus, the influence of the complex pedigree of descendants on an individual's genetic contribution to the population can be summarized through a single number: its reproductive value.},

This model is interesting because the perturbation series for the ground-state energy diverges. To investigate the reason for this divergence, we analytically continue the energy levels of the Hamiltonian H into the complex {$\lambda$} plane. Using WKB techniques, we find that the energy levels as a function of {$\lambda$}, or more generally of {$\lambda\alpha$}, have an infinite number of branch points with a limit point at {$\lambda$}=0. Thus, the origin is not an isolated singularity. Level crossing occurs at each branch point. If we choose {$\alpha$}=13, the resolvent (z-H)-1 has no branch cut. However, for all z it has an infinite sequence of poles which have a limit point at the origin. The anharmonic oscillator is of particular interest to field theoreticians because it is a model of {$\lambda\phi$}4 field theory in one-dimensional space-time. The unusual and unexpected properties exhibited by this model may give some indication of the analytic structure of a more realistic field theory.},

It computes the ratio of the (excess) net return over the strategy standard deviation. However, the elements to compute the Sharpe ratio, namely, the expected returns and the volatilities are unknown numbers and need to be estimated statistically. This means that the Sharpe ratio used by funds is likely to be error prone because of statistical estimation errors. In this paper, we provide various tests to measure the quality of the Sharpe ratios. By quality, we are aiming at measuring whether a manager was indeed lucky of skillful. The test assesses this through the statistical significance of the Sharpe ratio. We not only look at the traditional Sharpe ratio but also compute a modified Sharpe insensitive to used Capital. We provide various statistical tests that can be used to precisely quantify the fact that the Sharpe is statistically significant. We illustrate in particular the number of trades for a given Sharpe level that provides statistical significance as well as the impact of auto-correlation by providing reference tables that provides the minimum required Sharpe ratio for a given time period and correlation. We also provide for a Sharpe ratio of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 the skill percentage given the auto-correlation level.},

In the first part of the paper, we introduce a covariant regularization of entanglement entropy tailored to curved spacetimes; this regularization allows us to propose precise definitions for the concepts of black hole ``exterior entropy'' and ``radiation entropy.'' For a Vaidya model of collapse we find results consistent with the standard thermodynamic properties of Hawking radiation. In the second part of the paper, we compute the vacuum entanglement entropy of various spherically-symmetric spacetimes of interest, including the nonsingular black hole model of Bardeen, Hayward, Frolov and Rovelli-Vidotto and the ``black hole fireworks'' model of Haggard-Rovelli. We discuss specifically the role of event and trapping horizons in connection with the behavior of the radiation entropy at future null infinity. We observe in particular that (i) in the presence of an event horizon the radiation entropy diverges at the end of the evaporation process, (ii) in models of nonsingular evaporation (with a trapped region but no event horizon) the generalized second law holds only at early times and is violated in the ``purifying'' phase, (iii) at late times the radiation entropy can become negative (i.e. the radiation can be less correlated than the vacuum) before going back to zero leading to an up-down-up behavior for the Page curve of a unitarily evaporating black hole.},

The model we focus on are Lotka--Volterra equations with symmetric random interactions. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by our numerical studies, shows that for strong and heterogeneous interactions the system displays multiple equilibria which are all marginally stable. This property allows us to obtain general identities between diversity and single species responses, which generalize and saturate May's stability bound. By connecting the model to systems studied in condensed matter physics, we show that the multiple equilibria regime is analogous to a critical spin-glass phase. This relation suggests new experimental ways to probe marginal stability.},

  abstract = {During their evolution, proteins explore sequence space via an interplay between random mutations and phenotypic selection. Here we build upon recent progress in reconstructing data-driven fitness landscapes for families of homologous proteins, to propose stochastic models of experimental protein evolution. These models predict quantitatively important features of experimentally evolved sequence libraries, like fitness distributions and position-specific mutational spectra. They also allow us to efficiently simulate sequence libraries for a vast array of combinations of experimental parameters like sequence divergence, selection strength and library size. We showcase the potential of the approach in re-analyzing two recent experiments to determine protein structure from signals of epistasis emerging in experimental sequence libraries. To be detectable, these signals require sufficiently large and sufficiently diverged libraries. Our modeling framework offers a quantitative explanation for the variable success of recently published experiments. Furthermore, we can forecast the outcome of time- and resource-intensive evolution experiments, opening thereby a way to computationally optimize experimental protocols.},

We also relate its dominant part to the Reidemeister torsion of the complex, thereby generalizing previous results of Barrett and Naish-Guzman. The main limitation to our approach is the presence of singularities in the representation variety of the fundamental group of the complex; we illustrate this issue in the well-known case of two-dimensional manifolds.},

While this result is easy to show (and well known) for uncorrelated disorder, its robustness with respect to strong quenched correlations is surprising. We show in detail how the critical temperature is renormalized by these correlations. We close with speculation on possible applications of random tensor theory to finite-range spin glass models.},

Here, we analyze a model in which the response is some form of punishment that is directed solely at noncooperators. We refer to such alternative forms of punishment as retribution. We show that cooperation enforced by retribution can lead to the evolution of cooperation in two qualitatively different ways. (1) If benefits of cooperation to an individual are greater than the costs to a single individual of coercing the other n - 1 individuals to cooperate, then strategies which cooperate and punish noncooperators, strategies which cooperate only if punished, and, sometimes, strategies which cooperate but do not punish will coexist in the long run. (2) If the costs of being punished are large enough, moralistic strategies which cooperate, punish noncooperators, and punish those who do not punish noncooperators can be evolutionarily stable. We also show, however, that moralistic strategies can cause any individually costly behavior to be evolutionarily stable, whether or not it creates a group benefit.},

  abstract = {This review is focused on the borderline region of theoretical physics and mathematics. First, we describe numerical methods for the acceleration of the convergence of series. These provide a useful toolbox for theoretical physics which has hitherto not received the attention it actually deserves. The unifying concept for convergence acceleration methods is that in many cases, one can reach much faster convergence than by adding a particular series term by term. In some cases, it is even possible to use a divergent input series, together with a suitable sequence transformation, for the construction of numerical methods that can be applied to the calculation of special functions. This review both aims to provide some practical guidance as well as a groundwork for the study of specialized literature. As a second topic, we review some recent developments in the field of Borel resummation, which is generally recognized as one of the most versatile methods for the summation of factorially divergent (perturbation) series. Here, the focus is on algorithms which make optimal use of all information contained in a finite set of perturbative coefficients. The unifying concept for the various aspects of the Borel method investigated here is given by the singularities of the Borel transform, which introduce ambiguities from a mathematical point of view and lead to different possible physical interpretations. The two most important cases are: (i) the residues at the singularities correspond to the decay width of a resonance; and (ii) the presence of the singularities indicates the existence of nonperturbative contributions which cannot be accounted for on the basis of a Borel resummation and require generalizations toward resurgent expansions. Both of these cases are illustrated by examples.},

This series may then be summed using Borel summation methods. We also introduce a new summation method for the AO series (which is a practical necessity to obtain accurate energy levels of the excited states). We obtain a numerical accuracy for (EPT - Eexact)Eexact of at least 10-7 (using 20 orders of perturbation theory) and 10-3 (using only 2 orders of perturbation theory) for all couplings and all energy levels of the anharmonic oscillator. The methods are applicable also to the double-well potential (DWP, the AO with a negative mass-squared). The only change is that now the effective coupling is unbounded as {$\lambda$} {$\rightarrow$} 0. The series in {$\Lambda$} is, however, still summable. The relative accuracy in the energy levels for 20 orders of perturbation theory varies from 10-7 for large coupling to 1\% at {$\lambda$} = 0.1 and to 10\% at {$\lambda$} = .05.

  abstract = {Natural selection is commonly seen not just as an explanation for adaptive evolution, but as the inevitable consequence of ``heritable variation in fitness among individuals''. Although it remains embedded in biological concepts, such a formalisation makes it tempting to explore whether this precondition may be met not only in life as we know it, but also in other physical systems. This would imply that these systems are subject to natural selection and may perhaps be investigated in a biological framework, where properties are typically examined in light of their putative functions. Here we relate the major questions that were debated during a three-day workshop devoted to discussing whether natural selection may take place in non-living physical systems. We start this report with a brief overview of research fields dealing with ``life-like'' or ``proto-biotic'' systems, where mimicking evolution by natural selection in test tubes stands as a major objective. We contend the challenge may be as much conceptual as technical. Taking the problem from a physical angle, we then discuss the framework of dissipative structures. Although life is viewed in this context as a particular case within a larger ensemble of physical phenomena, this approach does not provide general principles from which natural selection can be derived. Turning back to evolutionary biology, we ask to what extent the most general formulations of the necessary conditions or signatures of natural selection may be applicable beyond biology. In our view, such a cross-disciplinary jump is impeded by reliance on individuality as a central yet implicit and loosely defined concept. Overall, these discussions thus lead us to conjecture that understanding, in physico-chemical terms, how individuality emerges and how it can be recognised, will be essential in the search for instances of evolution by natural selection outside of living systems.},

The basic assumption is that the rare event used in the conditioning is a large deviation-type event, characterized by a convex rate function. Under this assumption, we construct the driven process via a generalization of Doob's h-transform, used in the context of bridge processes, and show that this process is equivalent to the conditioned process in the long-time limit. The notion of equivalence that we consider is based on the logarithmic equivalence of path measures and implies that the two processes have the same typical states. In constructing the driven process, we also prove equivalence with the so-called exponential tilting of the Markov process, often used with importance sampling to simulate rare events and giving rise, from the point of view of statistical mechanics, to a nonequilibrium version of the canonical ensemble. Other links between our results and the topics of bridge processes, quasi-stationary distributions, stochastic control, and conditional limit theorems are mentioned.},

Special attention is given to a simple derivation of the form of these Hamiltonians in terms of the so(2, 1) algebra generators. In particular, the usually exploited tilting transformation is avoided, and the whole derivation is presented in an extremely simple and straightforward way. The present approach stresses the similarity and mutual relationship between the systems studied and, in addition to introducing some novel techniques and providing considerable insight into the overall structure of these problems, also has a definite pedagogical value.},

It is emphasized that there is a formal similarity between divergent series in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and those series occurring in quantum field theory. It is indicated that studies of divergent series in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics can be helpful in the verification of suminability techniques in quantum field theory. The general problems of the application of perturbation theory to the study of the hydrogen atom in external fields are discussed. It is shown how the problem of the continuous spectrum can be bypassed. Further it is shown that algebraic techniques are very useful for a transparent formulation of perturbation theory. The theory is applied to the study of the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field and in an electric field and also to the study of the hydrogen molecule ion. The results for the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field and the hydrogen molecule ion are discussed in detail and the large order behavior of perturbation terms is compared with analytic formulas. Finally the questions of the summability for the series corresponding to the quartic anharmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field are discussed. It is seen that large order perturbation theory can be built into a continued fraction representation of a divergent perturbation series. Numerical results are presented for the two perturbation series mentioned above.},

Our approach---statistical dynamics---combines methods from both statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory in a way that offers an alternative to current ``landscape'' models of evolutionary optimization. We describe the population dynamics on the macroscopic level of fitness classes or phenotype subbasins, while averaging out the genotypic variation that is consistent with a macroscopic state. Metastability in epochal evolution occurs solely at the macroscopic level of the fitness distribution. While a balance between selection and mutation maintains a quasistationary distribution of fitness, individuals diffuse randomly through selectively neutral subbasins in genotype space. Sudden innovations occur when, through this diffusion, a genotypic portal is discovered that connects to a new subbasin of higher fitness genotypes. In this way, we identify evolutionary innovations with the unfolding and stabilization of a new dimension in the macroscopic state space. The architectural view of subbasins and portals in genotype space clarifies how frozen accidents and the resulting phenotypic constraints guide the evolution to higher complexity.},

Using a synthetic framework of phenotypic evolution that draws from adaptive dynamics and quantitative genetics approaches, we explore how the number of traits under selection influences convergence stability and evolutionary stability in models for coevolution in multidimensional phenotype spaces. Our results allow us to identify three different effects of trait dimensionality on stability. First are (i) a ``combinatorial effect'': without epistasis and genetic correlations, a higher number of trait dimensions offers more opportunities for equilibria to be unstable; and (ii) epistatic interactions, that is, fitness interactions between traits, which tend to destabilize evolutionary equilibria; this effect increases with the dimension of phenotype space. These first two effects influence both convergence stability and evolutionary stability, while (iii) genetic correlations (due, e.g., to pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium) can affect only convergence stability. We illustrate the general prediction that increased dimensionality destabilizes evolutionary equilibria using examples drawn from well-studied classical models of frequency-dependent competition for resources, adaptation to a spatially heterogeneous environment, and antagonistic coevolution. In addition, our analyses show that increased dimensionality can favor diversification, for example, in the form of local adaptation, as well as evolutionary escape.},

  abstract = {This three-volume work treats divergent series in one variable, especially those arising as solutions to complex ordinary differential or difference equations, and methods for extracting their analytic information. It provides a systematic construction, illustrated with examples, of the various theories of summability and the theory of resurgence developed since the 1980s. The Stokes phenomenon, for both linear and non-linear equations, plays an underlying and unifying role throughout the volumes. Applications presented include resurgent analyses of the First Painlev{\'e} equation and of the tangent-to-identity germs of diffeomorphisms of C, and links to differential Galois theory and the Riemann-Hilbert problem for linear differential equations. The volumes are aimed at graduate students, mathematicians in general, and theoretical physicists who are interested in the theories of monodromy, summability, and resurgence, as well as the current problems in the field.Although the three volumes are closely related, they have been organized to be read independently. The prerequisites are advanced calculus, especially holomorphic functions in one complex variable, and differential algebra. Moreover; the various themes are presented thoroughly step-by-step so as to be accessible to first-year graduate students in mathematics. This three-volume treatise should become a reference on summability and resurgence.},

Making use of the rapidly growing sequence databases, we analyze nucleotide coevolution across homologous sequences via Direct-Coupling Analysis to detect nucleotide-nucleotide contacts. For a representative set of riboswitches, we show that the results of Direct-Coupling Analysis in combination with a generalized Nussinov algorithm systematically improve the results of RNA secondary structure prediction beyond traditional covariance approaches based on mutual information. Even more importantly, we show that the results of Direct-Coupling Analysis are enriched in tertiary structure contacts. By integrating these predictions into molecular modeling tools, systematically improved tertiary structure predictions can be obtained, as compared to using secondary structure information alone.},

  abstract = {A fitness landscape relates the genotype of an organism to its reproductive capacity and therefore has a central role in evolutionary biology.Introduced in the 1930s, the fitness landscape concept has long been used primarily as a metaphor. This has recently changed, as new experimental tools allow the systematic construction and analysis of combinations of predefined sets of genetic mutations.The topography of the fitness landscape is determined by how different mutations interact in their effect on fitness. A particular type of epistasis known as sign epistasis causes the fitness landscape to be rugged, possibly with multiple peaks.A survey of experimental studies shows that most empirical fitness landscapes are rugged, but the amount of ruggedness varies systematically depending on the way the mutations that form the landscape have been chosen.On rugged fitness landscapes, the accessibility of mutational pathways towards higher fitness is reduced, which makes the evolutionary process more constrained and hence predictable. In addition, predictability depends on population size in ways that can be explored using mathematical modelling.A key challenge for the future is to extend current fitness landscape studies to genome-wide scales and to develop models that are informed by the interactions of biomolecules.},

Our model incorporates individual memory of exposure to a contagious entity (e.g. a rumor or disease), variable magnitudes of exposure (dose sizes), and heterogeneity in the susceptibility of individuals. Through analysis and simulation, we examine in detail the case where individuals may recover from an infection and then immediately become susceptible again (analogous to the so-called SIS model). We identify three basic classes of contagion models which we call epidemic threshold, vanishing critical mass, and critical mass classes, where each class of models corresponds to different strategies for prevention or facilitation. We find that the conditions for a particular contagion model to belong to one of the these three classes depend only on memory length and the probabilities of being infected by one and two exposures, respectively. These parameters are in principle measurable for real contagious influences or entities, thus yielding empirical implications for our model. We also study the case where individuals attain permanent immunity once recovered, finding that epidemics inevitably die out but may be surprisingly persistent when individuals possess memory.},

This process requires a series of recombination reactions in which the internal guide sequence of a nascent catalytic complex makes specific interactions with a complement triplet, CAU, in the oligomers. However, if the CAU were mutated, promiscuous self-assembly may be possible, lessening the dependence on a particular set of oligomer sequences. Here, we assayed whether oligomers containing mutations in the CAU triplet could still self-construct Azoarcus ribozymes. The mutations CAC, CAG, CUU and GAU all inhibited self-assembly to some degree, but did not block it completely in 100 mM MgCl2. Oligomers containing the CAC mutation retained the most self-assembly activity, while those containing GAU retained the least, indicating that mutations more 5{$\prime$} in this triplet are the most deleterious. Self-assembly systems containing additional mutant locations were progressively less functional. Analyses of properly self-assembled ribozymes revealed that, of two recombination mechanisms possible for self-assembly, termed `tF2' and `R2F2', the simpler one-step `tF2' mechanism is utilized when mutations exist. These data suggest that self-assembling systems are more facile than previously believed, and have relevance to the origin of complex ribozymes during the RNA World.},

Everyone benefits on average, the theory goes, despite the cost to those doing the punishing. But most of our interactions are repeated, and in such cases punishment can lead to retaliation. Using a variant of the 'Prisoner's Dilemma' game, Dreber et al. find that punishment increases the frequency of cooperation, but not the average payoff. Costly punishments confer no overall advantage to the group. And players who end up with the highest total payoff ('winners') tend not to use punishment, while those with the lowest payoff ('losers') punish most frequently. It seems that costly punishment may not have evolved to promote cooperation, but for some other purpose.},

We find that unexpected losses increase sentence lengths assigned by judges during the week following the game. Unexpected wins, or losses that were expected to be close contests ex ante have no impact. The effects of these emotional shocks are asymmetrically borne by black defendants. The impact of upset losses on sentence lengths is larger for defendants if their cases are handled by judges who received their bachelor's degrees from the university with which the football team is affiliated.  Different falsification tests and a number of auxiliary analyses demonstrate the robustness of the findings. These results provide evidence for the impact of emotions in one domain on decisions in a completely unrelated domain among a uniformly highly educated group of individuals (judges) who make decisions after deliberation that involve high stakes (sentence lengths). They also point to the existence of a subtle and previously-unnoticed capricious application of sentencing.},

Unlike other creatures, people frequently cooperate with genetically unrelated strangers, often in large groups, with people they will never meet again, and when reputation gains are small or absent. These patterns of cooperation cannot be explained by the nepotistic motives associated with the evolutionary theory of kin selection and the selfish motives associated with signalling theory or the theory of reciprocal altruism. Here we show experimentally that the altruistic punishment of defectors is a key motive for the explanation of cooperation. Altruistic punishment means that individuals punish, although the punishment is costly for them and yields no material gain. We show that cooperation flourishes if altruistic punishment is possible, and breaks down if it is ruled out. The evidence indicates that negative emotions towards defectors are the proximate mechanism behind altruistic punishment. These results suggest that future study of the evolution of human cooperation should include a strong focus on explaining altruistic punishment.},

  abstract = {This paper provides strong evidence challenging the self-interest assumption that dominates the behavioral sciences and much evolutionary thinking. The evidence indicates that many people have a tendency to voluntarily cooperate, if treated fairly, and to punish noncooperators. We call this behavioral propensity ``strong reciprocity'' and show empirically that it can lead to almost universal cooperation in circumstances in which purely self-interested behavior would cause a complete breakdown of cooperation. In addition, we show that people are willing to punish those who behaved unfairly towards a third person or who defected in a Prisoner's Dilemma game with a third person. This suggests that strong reciprocity is a powerful device for the enforcement of social norms involving, for example, food sharing or collective action. Strong reciprocity cannot be rationalized as an adaptive trait by the leading evolutionary theories of human cooperation (in other words, kin selection, reciprocal altruism, indirect reciprocity, and costly signaling theory). However, multilevel selection theories of cultural evolution are consistent with strong reciprocity.},

We hypothesize that egalitarian distribution norms and cooperation norms apply in our experiments, and that third parties, whose economic payoff is unaffected by the norm violation, may be willing to enforce these norms although the enforcement is costly for them. Almost two-thirds of the third parties indeed punished the violation of the distribution norm and their punishment increased the more the norm was violated. Likewise, up to roughly 60\% of the third parties punished violations of the cooperation norm. Thus, our results show that the notion of strong reciprocity extends to the sanctioning behavior of ``unaffected'' third parties. In addition, these experiments suggest that third-party punishment games are powerful tools for studying the characteristics and the content of social norms. Further experiments indicate that second parties, whose economic payoff is reduced by the norm violation, punish the violation much more strongly than do third parties.},

The elicitation of conditional contributions in combination with a within subject design allows us to investigate belief-independent and type-specific reactions to heterogeneity. We find that, on average, heterogeneity in returns decreases unconditional contributions but affects contributions only weakly. Uncertainty in addition to heterogeneity reduces conditional contributions slightly. Individual reactions to heterogeneity differ systematically. Selfish subjects and one third of conditional cooperators do not react to heterogeneity whereas the reactions of the remaining conditional cooperators vary. A substantial part of heterogeneity in reactions can be explained by inequity aversion with respect to different reference groups.},

Yet it is widely treated as a subset of population genetics, and thus its scope is artificially limited. As a result, the key issues of how rapidly evolution occurs and its coupling to ecology have not been satisfactorily addressed and formulated. The lack of widespread appreciation for, and understanding of, the evolutionary process has arguably retarded the development of biology as a science, with disastrous consequences for its applications to medicine, ecology, and the global environment. This review focuses on evolution as a problem in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, where the key dynamical modes are collective, as evidenced by the plethora of mobile genetic elements whose role in shaping evolution has been revealed by modern genomic surveys. We discuss how condensed matter physics concepts might provide a useful perspective in evolutionary biology, the conceptual failings of the modern evolutionary synthesis, the open-ended growth of complexity, and the quintessentially self-referential nature of evolutionary dynamics.},

The law sometimes provides people with sanctioning mechanisms to enforce pro-social behavior. Experimental evidence on voluntary public goods provision shows that the option to punish others substantially improves cooperation, even if punishment is costly. However, these studies focus on situations where there is no uncertainty about the behavior of others. We investigate sanctions in a world with ``reasonable doubt'' about the contributions of others. Interestingly, people reveal a high willingness to punish even if their information about cooperation rates is highly inaccurate. If there is some nontrivial degree of noise, punishment (1) cannot establish cooperation high and (2) reduces welfare even below the level of a setting without punishment. Our findings suggest that sufficient information accuracy about others' behavior is crucial for the efficiency of sanction mechanisms. If a situation is characterized by low information accuracy, precluding sanctions, for example, through high standards of proof, is likely to be optimal.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have long sought a way to explain how the remarkable biodiversity observed in nature is maintained. On the one hand, simple models of interacting competitors cannot produce the stable persistence of very large ecological communities 1-5. On the other hand, neutral models 6-9 , in which species do not interact and diversity is maintained by immigration and speciation, yield unrealistically small fluctuations in population abundance 10 , and a strong positive correlation between a species' abundance and its age 11 , contrary to empirical evidence. Models allowing for the robust persistence of large communities of interacting competitors are lacking. Here we show that very diverse communities could persist thanks to the stabilizing role of higher-order interactions 12,13 , in which the presence of a species influences the interaction between other species. Although higher-order interactions have been studied for decades 14-16 , their role in shaping ecological communities is still unclear 5. The inclusion of higher-order interactions in competitive network models stabilizes dynamics, making species coexistence robust to the perturbation of both population abundance and parameter values. We show that higher-order interactions have strong effects in models of closed ecological communities, as well as of open communities in which new species are constantly introduced. In our framework, higher-order interactions are completely defined by pairwise interactions, facilitating empirical parameterization and validation of our models. We studied deterministic models describing communities in which the number of individuals is large and the system is isolated (for example, bacterial strain competition in laboratory conditions 17); in Supplementary Information section S4 we examine the case in which the dynamics are stochastic, which best describe communities in which the number of individuals is finite. Finally, we allow new species to be introduced at a given rate, allowing for a comparison with neutral models (Supplementary Information section S5). Although our results hold for a wide class of systems, to exemplify our findings we consider the dynamics of a forest in which there is a fixed, large number of trees, so that we can simply track x i (t), the proportion of trees of species i at time t, with {$\sum$} i x i (t) = 1. At each step, a randomly selected tree dies, opening a gap in the canopy (that is, we initially assume identical per capita death rates for all species). This event ignites competition among seedlings to fill the gap. Suppose that all individuals produce the same number of seedlings, and that we pick two seedlings at random, with the winner of the competition filling the gap (Supplementary Fig. 1). The matrix H encodes the dominance relationships among the species: H ij is the probability that the first seedling, belonging to species i, wins against the second seedling, belonging to species j. Clearly, H ii = {$\frac{1}{2}$} for all i, and H ij + H ji = 1 for all i and j. If all H ij = {$\frac{1}{2}$}, we recover a neutral model. At the other extreme lies a model in which each pair (H ij , H ji) is either (1,0) or (0,1) (that is, species i always wins or always loses against j), in which case H is called a 'tournament matrix' 18. A number of results have been derived for this case 19 , showing that coexistence is possible when species form 'intransitive cycles' of competitive dominance, such as in the rock-paper-scissors game 20. Here we extend these previous findings 19 to the most general case in which interactions range from neutral to complete dominance. We can approximate the dynamics of the n species as (see Methods): {$\sum$} = - x t t x t H x t x t d () d ()2 () () (1) i i j ij j i Where - x i (t) models the death process, and x i (t)2H ij x j (t) is the probability of picking two seedlings of species i and j, with i winning the competition. The factor 2 arises from the fact that we could pick i first and j second, or vice versa, with the same outcome. Simple manipulations (Supplementary Information section S1) show that these equations are equivalent to the system: {$\sum$} = x t t x t P x t d () d () () (2) i i j ij j which is the celebrated replicator equation 21,22 for a zero-sum, symmetric matrix game with two players and payoffs encoded in the skew-symmetric matrix P = H - H t. This equation is at the core of evolutionary game theory, with applications spanning multiple fields 23,24. Thanks to this equivalence, we are able to characterize the dynamics. Unless specified, we assume H to be of full rank, that is, all of its eigenvalues are non-zero. We show in the Supplementary Information that violations of this assumption are unbiological, amounting to degenerate cases in which slightly altering the parameters dramatically changes the outcome. Suppose that we start with n species and initial conditions x i (0) {$>$} 0, and that we let the dynamics unfold. Once the transient dynamics have elapsed, we find k {$\leq$} n coexisting species, with k being odd. The n - k species that go extinct do so irrespective of initial conditions, and the k coexisting species cycle neutrally around a unique equilibrium point x* (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information section S1). How large is k when we build the matrix H at random? When drawing H ij (with i {$<$} j) from the uniform distribution U[0,1] and setting the corresponding H ji = 1 - H ij , we find that the probability of having k species coexisting when starting with n species, p(k{\textbar} n) = 0 when k is even, and {\textbar} = - () p k n () 2 n k n 1 when k is odd 25 (Supplementary Fig. 2). This matches what is found for tournament games 18,19,26 , in which dominance is complete: we expect half of the initial species to coexist, irrespective of the choice of n; moreover, monodominance is extremely rare, and about as rare as the coexistence of all species. Thus, this theory generates high biodiversity without the need to fine-tune parameters. This model can generate any species-abundance distribution: for any choice of x*, we can build infinitely many matrices H such that equations (1) and (2) have x* as an equilibrium (Supplementary Information section S1). We note that this is true irrespective of the fact that x* contains an even or odd number of species (Fig. 1)-but the case}

The ability of ecological communities to recover after small perturbations of the species abundances (local asymptotic stability) has been well studied, whereas the likelihood of a community to persist when the conditions change (structural stability) has received much less attention. Our goal is to understand the effects of diversity, interaction strengths and ecological network structure on the volume of parameter space leading to feasible equilibria. We develop a geometrical framework to study the range of conditions necessary for feasible coexistence. We show that feasibility is determined by few quantities describing the interactions, yielding a nontrivial complexity--feasibility relationship. Analysing more than 100 empirical networks, we show that the range of coexistence conditions in mutualistic systems can be analytically predicted. Finally, we characterize the geometric shape of the feasibility domain, thereby identifying the direction of perturbations that are more likely to cause extinctions.},

  abstract = {Insights into what stabilizes natural food webs have always been limited by a fundamental dilemma: Studies either need to make unwarranted simplifying assumptions, which undermines their relevance, or only examine few replicates of small food webs, which hampers the robustness of findings. We used generalized modeling to study several billion replicates of food webs with nonlinear interactions and up to 50 species. In this way, first we show that higher variability in link strengths stabilizes food webs only when webs are relatively small, whereas larger webs are instead destabilized. Second, we reveal a new power law describing how food-web stability scales with the number of species and their connectance. Third, we report two universal rules: Food-web stability is enhanced when (i) species at a high trophic level feed on multiple prey species and (ii) species at an intermediate trophic level are fed upon by multiple predator species.}

  abstract = {Economists and biologists have proposed a distinction between two mechanisms -- ``strong'' and ``weak'' reciprocity -- that may explain the evolution of human sociality. Weak reciprocity theorists emphasize the benefits of long-term cooperation and the use of low-cost strategies to deter free-riders. Strong reciprocity theorists, in contrast, claim that cooperation in social dilemma games can be sustained by costly punishment mechanisms, even in one-shot and finitely repeated games. To support this claim, they have generated a large body of evidence concerning the willingness of experimental subjects to punish uncooperative free-riders at a cost to themselves. In this article, I distinguish between a ``narrow'' and a ``wide'' reading of the experimental evidence. Under the narrow reading, punishment experiments are just useful devices to measure psychological propensities in controlled laboratory conditions. Under the wide reading, they replicate a mechanism that supports cooperation also in ``real-world'' situations outside the laboratory. I argue that the wide interpretation must be tested using a combination of laboratory data and evidence about cooperation ``in the wild.'' In spite of some often-repeated claims, there is no evidence that cooperation in the small egalitarian societies studied by anthropologists is enforced by means of costly punishment. Moreover, studies by economic and social historians show that social dilemmas in the wild are typically solved by institutions that coordinate punishment, reduce its cost, and extend the horizon of cooperation. The lack of field evidence for costly punishment suggests important constraints about what forms of cooperation can or cannot be sustained by means of decentralised policing.},

Their behaviour at large orders provides information about whether they define the theory uniquely (the problem of Borel summability). It suggests methods to extract numerical information from the series when the expansion parameter is not small.The articles reprinted here deal with the explicit evaluation of large-order behaviour in many quantum mechanics and field theory models. The large-order behaviour is related to barrier penetration effects for unphysical values of the expansion parameter, which can be calculated by WKB or instanton methods. The calculation of critical exponents of \&fgr;4 field theory is presented as a practical application.},

The existing empirical evidence for the higher levels of cooperation when altruistic punishment is present versus when it is absent systematically ignores the institutional competition inherent in human societies. Whether punishment would be deliberately adopted and would similarly enhance cooperation when directly competing with nonpunishment institutions is highly controversial in light of recent findings on the detrimental effects of punishment. We show experimentally that a sanctioning institution is the undisputed winner in a competition with a sanction-free institution. Despite initial aversion, the entire population migrates successively to the sanctioning institution and strongly cooperates, whereas the sanction-free society becomes fully depopulated. The findings demonstrate the competitive advantage of sanctioning institutions and exemplify the emergence and manifestation of social order driven by institutional selection.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Using the highest standards of exposition and rigor, the authors develop a novel formulation of thermodynamics that can be viewed as a moderate-sized system theory as compared to statistical thermodynamics. This middle-ground theory involves deterministic large-scale dynamical system models that bridge the gap between classical and statistical thermodynamics. The authors' theory is motivated by the fact that a discipline as cardinal as thermodynamics--entrusted with some of the most perplexing secrets of our universe--demands far more than physical mathematics as its underpinning. Even though many great physicists, such as Archimedes, Newton, and Lagrange, have humbled us with their mathematically seamless eurekas over the centuries, this book suggests that a great many physicists and engineers who have developed the theory of thermodynamics seem to have forgotten that mathematics, when used rigorously, is the irrefutable pathway to truth. This book uses system theoretic ideas to bring coherence, clarity, and precision to an extremely important and poorly understood classical area of science.},

Many experiments on so-called public goods games have shown that in the absence of such institutions, individuals are willing to punish defectors, even at a cost to themselves. Theoretical models confirm that social norms prescribing the punishment of uncooperative behavior are stable---once established, they prevent dissident minorities from spreading. But how can such costly punishing behavior gain a foothold in the population? A surprisingly simple model shows that if individuals have the option to stand aside and abstain from the joint endeavor, this paves the way for the emergence and establishment of cooperative behavior based on the punishment of defectors. Paradoxically, the freedom to withdraw from the common enterprise leads to enforcement of social norms. Joint enterprises that are compulsory rather than voluntary are less likely to lead to cooperation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

These complexes can then catalyze a sequence of energy-neutral recombination reactions utilizing other oligomers as substrates, assembling covalent versions of the ribozyme. Up to 17\% of the original fragments are converted into {$\sim$}200 nucleotide products in 8 hr. Assembly occurs primarily by only one of many possible pathways, and the reaction is driven in the correct and forward direction by the burial of key base-pairing regions in stems after recombination. Autocatalysis, and hence self-replication, is inferred by a reaction rate increase upon doping the reaction with full-length RNA.},

Here, experimental results from 15 diverse populations show that (i) all populations demonstrate some willingness to administer costly punishment as unequal behavior increases, (ii) the magnitude of this punishment varies substantially across populations, and (iii) costly punishment positively covaries with altruistic behavior across populations.

The stationary state of the latter is called the ancestral distribution, which turns out as a key for the study of mutation--selection balance. We find that the ancestral genotype frequencies determine the sensitivity of the equilibrium mean fitness to changes in the corresponding fitness values and discuss implications for the evolution of mutational robustness. We further show that the difference between the ancestral and the population mean fitness, termed mutational loss, provides a measure for the sensitivity of the equilibrium mean fitness to changes in the mutation rate. The interrelation of the loss and the mutation load is discussed. For a class of models in which the number of mutations in an individual is taken as the trait value, and fitness is a function of the trait, we use the ancestor formulation to derive a simple maximum principle, from which the mean and variance of fitness and the trait may be derived; the results are exact for a number of limiting cases, and otherwise yield approximations which are accurate for a wide range of parameters. These results are applied to threshold phenomena caused by the interplay of selection and mutation (known as error thresholds). They lead to a clarification of concepts, as well as criteria for the existence of error thresholds.},

Therefore, most of the methods offered by the library are projection methods such as Arnoldi or Lanczos, or other methods with similar properties. SLEPc provides basic methods as well as more sophisticated algorithms. It also provides built-in support for spectral transformations such as the shift-and-invert technique. SLEPc is a general library in the sense that it covers standard and generalized eigenvalue problems, both Hermitian and non-Hermitian, with either real or complex arithmetic.SLEPc can be easily applied to real world problems. To illustrate this, several case studies arising from real applications are presented and solved with SLEPc with little programming effort. The addressed problems include a matrix-free standard problem, a complex generalized problem, and a singular value decomposition. The implemented codes exhibit good properties regarding flexibility as well as parallel performance.},

  abstract = {Research into the RNA World paradigm is active, and new discoveries in synthetic organic chemistry and biochemistry routinely provide new insights.The field of prebiotic chemistry is increasingly discovering phenomena that provide solutions to multiple (as opposed to single) problems simultaneously.A key issue in RNA World research is how RNAs might have made copies of themselves (that is, how they replicated). There are now several possible mechanisms of this process, and increasing focus is being placed on those that display autocatalytic feedback.Cooperation among various molecules was probably a key aspect of the RNA World, and at least three types of molecular cooperation could have been at play during the origins of life.Chemical alternatives to RNA per se may have existed at some point in the Earth's earliest history, and many efforts are underway to find and evaluate such structures.Network establishment was another process that had a large impact on the organization of the living state, from small molecules to large molecules and cell-like structures.},

Recent studies emphasise the importance of anger and its role in motivating individuals to punish free riders. However, we find that anger also triggers retaliatory behaviour by the punished individuals. This makes the enforcement of a cooperative norm more costly. We show that in addition to anger, `social' emotions like guilt need to be present for punishment to be an effective deterrent of uncooperative actions. They play a key role by subduing the desire of punished individuals to retaliate and by motivating them to behave more cooperatively in the future.},

Here we introduce a probabilistic model that describes the worldwide spread of infectious diseases and demonstrate that a forecast of the geographical spread of epidemics is indeed possible. This model combines a stochastic local infection dynamics among individuals with stochastic transport in a worldwide network, taking into account national and international civil aviation traffic. Our simulations of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak are in surprisingly good agreement with published case reports. We show that the high degree of predictability is caused by the strong heterogeneity of the network. Our model can be used to predict the worldwide spread of future infectious diseases and to identify endangered regions in advance. The performance of different control strategies is analyzed, and our simulations show that a quick and focused reaction is essential to inhibiting the global spread of epidemics.}

  abstract = {The observed cooperation on the level of genes, cells, tissues, and individuals has been the object of intense study by evolutionary biologists, mainly because cooperation often flourishes in biological systems in apparent contradiction to the selfish goal of survival inherent in Darwinian evolution. In order to resolve this paradox, evolutionary game theory has focused on the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD), which incorporates the essence of this conflict. Here, we encode strategies for the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) in terms of conditional probabilities that represent the response of decision pathways given previous plays. We find that if these stochastic strategies are encoded as genes that undergo Darwinian evolution, the environmental conditions that the strategies are adapting to determine the fixed point of the evolutionary trajectory, which could be either cooperation or defection. A transition between cooperative and defective attractors occurs as a function of different parameters such as mutation rate, replacement rate, and memory, all of which affect a player's ability to predict an opponent's behavior. These results imply that in populations of players that can use previous decisions to plan future ones, cooperation depends critically on whether the players can rely on facing the same strategies that they have adapted to. Defection, on the other hand, is the optimal adaptive response in environments that change so quickly that the information gathered from previous plays cannot usefully be integrated for a response.},

People may sanction those whose behavior is atypical -- even when that behavior benefits the group. We test our theory with a laboratory experiment.

The basic notions are introduced using ordinary integrals. The theoretical framework is applied to quantum mechanics and generalized to quantum field theories which, in particular, have important applications in the theory of critical phenomena. The material is presented at three levels of complexity: a) undergraduate, b) post-quantum mechanics I, c) graduate up to current research. The second part starts with a general introduction to resummation methods for divergent series. Subsequently, Borel's theory is implemented as a simple algorithm allowing for easy practical applications to numerous problems. This is illustrated for three typical examples, again with the above three levels of complexity. All non-trivial algebraic manipulation are programmed in special computer languages (REDUCE and RIEMANN). These algebraic as well as some numerical computer programs are supplied on a diskette to come with the book.},

Modified Bohr--Sommerfeld quantization conditions lead to generalized perturbative expansions which may be expressed in terms of nonanalytic factors of the form exp(-a/g), where a{$>$}0 is the instanton action, and power series in the coupling g, as well as logarithmic factors. The ground-state energy, for the specific Hamiltonians, is shown to be dominated by instanton effects, and we provide numerical evidence for the validity of the related conjectures.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

The contribution of the paper is two-fold: first, we discuss the above parametric approaches and investigate their performance through error analysis. Moreover, we argue that the ECF performs better than the ML over a wide range of shape parameter values, {$\alpha$} including values closest to 0 and 2 and that the ECF has a better convergence rate than the ML. Secondly, we compare the t location-scale distribution to the general stable distribution and show that the former fails to capture skewness which might exist in the data. This is observed through applying the ECF to commodity futures log-returns data to obtain the skewness parameter.},

In this limit the perturbative expansion in the quartic coupling constant, g, is dominated by a special class of ``melon'' diagrams. We study ``uncolored'' models of this type, which contain a single copy of real rank-3 tensor. Its three indices are distinguishable; therefore, the models possess O(N)3 symmetry with the tensor field transforming in the tri-fundamental representation. Such uncolored models also possess the large N limit dominated by the melon diagrams. The quantum mechanics of a real anticommuting tensor therefore has a similar large N limit to the model recently introduced by Witten as an implementation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which does not require disorder. Gauging the O(N)3 symmetry in our quantum mechanical model removes the nonsinglet states; therefore, one can search for its well-defined gravity dual. We point out, however, that the model possesses a vast number of gauge-invariant operators involving higher powers of the tensor field, suggesting that the complete gravity dual will be intricate. We also discuss the quantum mechanics of a complex 3-index anticommuting tensor, which has U(N)2{\texttimes}O(N) symmetry and argue that it is equivalent in the large N limit to a version of SYK model with complex fermions. Finally, we discuss similar models of a commuting tensor in dimension d. While the quartic interaction is not positive definite, we construct the large N Schwinger-Dyson equation for the two-point function and show that its solution is consistent with conformal invariance. We carry out a perturbative check of this result using the 4-{$\varepsilon$} expansion.},

Recent developments include prediction of reproducible patterns in parallel evolution experiments, forecasting the future of individual populations using data from their past, and controlled manipulation of evolutionary dynamics. Here we undertake a synthesis of central concepts for evolutionary predictions, based on examples of microbial and viral systems, cancer cell populations, and immune receptor repertoires. These systems have strikingly similar evolutionary dynamics driven by the competition of clades within a population. These dynamics are the basis for models that predict the evolution of clade frequencies, as well as broad genetic and phenotypic changes. Moreover, there are strong links between prediction and control, which are important for interventions such as vaccine or therapy design. All of these are key elements of what may become a predictive theory of evolution.},

This paper discusses the case for a UBC, focusing attention on its potential for helping young people to attain long-term positive outcomes in several dimensions of life, from employment to health. By looking at the experience of the Child Trust Fund, the paper also highlights lessons for how a UBC should be implemented in practice. It proposes a Citizen's Day: a coming-of-age occasion, marked by a ceremony at which a substantial UBC is awarded, along with the right to vote.},

In a given situation many different mutant phenotypes may have a fitness advantage over the residents, and are thus potential invaders, implying that the mutational process plays an important role in deciding which particular invasion will take place. By introducing an imaginary `Darwinian demon' in charge of mutations, one can examine the maximal role that mutation could play in determining evolutionary change. Taking into account pleiotropic mutations and shifting fitness landscapes, it seems likely that a Darwinian demon could exert considerable influence and most likely would be able to produce any viable form of organism. This kind of perspective can be helpful in clarifying concepts of evolutionary stability.},

To address this question, I derive explicit expressions for the statistical distribution of the Sharpe ratio using standard asymptotic theory under several sets of assumptions for the return-generating process---independently and identically distributed returns, stationary returns, and with time aggregation. I show that monthly Sharpe ratios cannot be annualized by multiplying by {\textsurd}12 except under very special circumstances, and I derive the correct method of conversion in the general case of stationary returns. In an illustrative empirical example of mutual funds and hedge funds, I find that the annual Sharpe ratio for a hedge fund can be overstated by as much as 65 percent because of the presence of serial correlation in monthly returns, and once this serial correlation is properly taken into account, the rankings of hedge funds based on Sharpe ratios can change dramatically.},

Our results allow for an energy-resolved interpretation of the many-body localization transition including the existence of an extensive many-body mobility edge. The ergodic phase is well characterized by Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistics, volume-law entanglement, and a full delocalization in the Hilbert space. Conversely, the localized regime displays Poisson statistics, area-law entanglement, and nonergodicity in the Hilbert space where a true localization never occurs. We perform finite-size scaling to extract the critical edge and exponent of the localization length divergence.},

Examining whole-genome sequence data describing a chronic case of influenza B in a severely immunocompromised child we infer an Ne of 2.5 {\texttimes} 107 (95\% confidence range 1.0 {\texttimes} 107 to 9.0 {\texttimes} 107) suggesting that genetic drift is of minimal importance during an established influenza infection. Our result, supported by data from influenza A infection, suggests that positive selection during within-host infection is primarily limited by the typically short period of infection. Atypically long infections may have a disproportionate influence upon global patterns of viral evolution.},

We prove an optimal bound on large order Feynman amplitudes, which shows that the BFL model is perturbatively more divergent than the former. We then upgrade this result to the constructive level, using, in a self-contained way, the modern tools of constructive field theory: we construct the Borel sum of the BFL perturbative series via a convergent `cactus' expansion, and establish the `ultraviolet' scaling of its Borel radius. Our method shows how the `sum over triangulations' in quantum gravity can be tamed rigorously, and paves the way for the renormalization program in group field theory.},

Here we review generalized modeling, an alternative approach for formulating dynamical models to gain insights into dynamics and bifurcations of uncertain systems. We argue that this approach deals elegantly with the uncertainties that exist in real world data and enables analytical insight or highly efficient numerical investigation. We provide a survey of recent successes of generalized modeling and a guide to the application of this modeling approach in future studies such as complex integrative ecological models.}

This issue --- commonly referred to as the diversity--stability debate --- is the subject of this review, which synthesizes historical ideas with recent advances. Both theory and empirical evidence agree that we should expect declines in diversity to accelerate the simplification of ecological communities.},

  abstract = {The Stark effect in hydrogen and the cubic anharmonic oscillator furnish examples of quantum systems where the perturbation results in a certain ionization probability by tunneling processes. Accordingly, the perturbed ground-state energy is shifted and broadened, thus acquiring an imaginary part which is considered to be a paradigm of nonperturbative behavior. Here we demonstrate how the low order coefficients of a divergent perturbation series can be used to obtain excellent approximations to both real and imaginary parts of the perturbed ground state eigenenergy. The key is to use analytic continuation functions with a built-in singularity structure within the complex plane of the coupling constant, which is tailored by means of Bender-Wu dispersion relations. In the examples discussed the analytic continuation functions are Gauss hypergeometric functions, which take as input fourth order perturbation theory and return excellent approximations to the complex perturbed eigenvalue. These functions are Borel consistent and dramatically outperform widely used Pad{\'e} and Borel-Pad{\'e} approaches, even for rather large values of the coupling constant.},

Solving this problem is a prerequisite for RNA design and is still a real challenge in bio-engineering. To improve the RNA inverse folding, we investigate an evolutionary algorithm implementing local mutations taking into account the nucleotide and canonical base pair distributions. We implement our algorithm as a simple open-source python program called aRNAque1. The empirical results show that aRNAque can solve some target structures previously unsolvable by the existing evolutionary algorithms benchmarked in this work. On the two benchmark datasets, {$\approx$} 72\% of the EteRNA100 dataset (respectively {$\approx$} 92\% using the Turner1999 energy parameter sets) and {$\approx$} 87\% of the non-EteRNA100 dataset and the designed sequences are of better quality. In comparison to existing tools, our EA implementation also shows a significant computational time improvement.},

Here we provide theoretical and numerical evidence for the hypothesis that genetic fragility is partly an evolutionary response to the multiple population bottlenecks experienced by viral populations at various stages of their life cycles. Modelling within-host viral populations as multi-type branching processes, we show that mutational fragility lowers the rate at which Muller's ratchet clicks and increases the survival probability through multiple bottlenecks. In the context of a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered epidemiological model, we find that the attack rate of fragile viral strains can exceed that of more robust strains, particularly at low infectivities and high mutation rates. Our findings highlight the importance of demographic events such as transmission bottlenecks in shaping the genetic architecture of viral pathogens.},

A click of the ratchet occurs when all individuals with the least number of deleterious mutations are lost irreversibly due to a stochastic fluctuation. In spite of the simplicity of the model, a quantitative understanding of the process remains an open challenge. In contrast to previous works, we here study a Moran model of the ratchet with overlapping generations. Employing an approximation which describes the fittest individuals as one class and the rest as a second class, we obtain closed analytical expressions of the ratchet rate in the rare clicking regime. As a click in this regime is caused by a rare, large fluctuation from a metastable state, we do not resort to a diffusion approximation but apply an approximation scheme which is especially well suited to describe extinction events from metastable states. This method also allows for a derivation of expressions for the quasi-stationary distribution of the fittest class. Additionally, we confirm numerically that the formulation with overlapping generations leads to the same results as the diffusion approximation and the corresponding Wright-Fisher model with non-overlapping generations.},

  abstract = {The similarity in the three-dimensional structures of homologous proteins imposes strong constraints on their sequence variability. It has long been suggested that the resulting correlations among amino acid compositions at different sequence positions can be exploited to infer spatial contacts within the tertiary protein structure. Crucial to this inference is the ability to disentangle direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently introduced direct-coupling analysis (DCA). Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of DCA, which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by DCA for a large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. DCA is shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intradomain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations, ligand-mediated residue couplings, and interdomain interactions in protein oligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by DCA can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.},

Below a certain threshold, however, punishment cannot prevent the decay of cooperation. In these cases, punishment opportunities reduce welfare.

  abstract = {The "iterated prisoner's dilemma" is the most widely used model for the evolution of cooperation in biological societies. Here we show that a heterogeneous population consisting of simple strategies, whose behavior is totally specified by the outcome of the previous round, can lead to persistent periodic or highly irregular (chaotic) oscillations in the frequencies of the strategies and the overall level of cooperation. The levels of cooperation jump up and down in an apparently unpredictable fashion. Small recurrent and simultaneous invasion attempts (caused by mutation) can change the evolutionary dynamics from converging to an evolutionarily stable strategy to periodic oscillations and chaos. Evolution can be twisted away from defection, toward cooperation. Adding "generous tit-for-tat" greatly increases the overall level of cooperation and can lead to long periods of steady cooperation. Since May's paper [May, R. M. (1976) Nature (London) 261, 459-467], "simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics" have been found in many biological applications, but here we provide an example of a biologically relevant evolutionary game whose dynamics display deterministic chaos. The simulations bear some resemblance to the irregular cycles displayed by the frequencies of host genotypes and specialized parasites in evolutionary "arms races" [Hamilton, W. D., Axelrod, R. \& Tanese, R. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 3566-3573; Seger, J. (1988) Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London B 319, 541-555].},

Genomes, cells, multicellular organisms, social insects, and human society are all based on cooperation. Cooperation means that selfish replicators forgo some of their reproductive potential to help one another. But natural selection implies competition and therefore opposes cooperation unless a specific mechanism is at work. Here I discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and group selection. For each mechanism, a simple rule is derived that specifies whether natural selection can lead to cooperation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In Axelrod's simulations, the simple strategy tit-for-tat did outstandingly well and subsequently became the major paradigm for reciprocal altruism4 12. Here we present extended evolutionary simulations of heterogeneous ensembles of probabilistic strategies including mutation and selection, and report the unexpected success of another protagonist: Pavlov. This strategy is as simple as tit-for-tat and embodies the fundamental behavioural mechanism win-stay, lose-shift, which seems to be a widespread rule13. Pavlov's success is based on two important advantages over tit-for-tat: it can correct occasional mistakes and exploit unconditional cooperators. This second feature prevents Pavlov populations from being undermined by unconditional cooperators, which in turn invite defectors. Pavlov seems to be more robust than tit-for-tat, suggesting that cooperative behaviour in natural situations may often be based on win-stay, lose-shift.},

Cooperative groups can be undermined by `cheaters' who selfishly exploit common resources, and a large body of theory predicts that cheats will usually displace cooperators. But a possible explanation of why cheats don't always prosper emerges from competition experiments between strains of yeast that act as cooperators and cheaters, competing for glucose and utilizing it either efficiently or `selfishly'. The results show that both strategies can coexist, because both are associated with costs and benefits. There is a cost to cheating; in this instance the production of fewer offspring than the opposition. A graphic --- really --- demonstration that natural selection can favour cooperation comes in a study by Ohtsuki et al. of the evolutionary dynamics of structured `virtual' populations formed of points on a graph. Cooperation is favoured if the benefit of the altruistic act divided by the cost exceeds the average number of neighbours. So cooperation can evolve as a consequence of this `social viscosity' even in the absence of reputation effects or strategic complexity.},

This heuristic is inspired by the kinetic partitioning mechanism, by which molecules follow alternative folding pathways to their native structure, some much faster than others. Similarly, our algorithm RAFFT starts by generating an ensemble of concurrent folding pathways ending in multiple metastable structures, which is in contrast with traditional thermodynamic approaches that find single structures with minimal free energies. When we constrained the algorithm to predict only 50 structures per sequence, near-native structures were found for RNA molecules of length {$\leq$} 200 nucleotides. Our heuristic has been tested on the coronavirus frameshifting stimulation element (CFSE): an ensemble of 68 distinct structures allowed us to produce complete folding kinetic trajectories, whereas known methods require evaluating millions of sub-optimal structures to achieve this result. Thanks to the fast Fourier transform on which RAFFT (RNA folding Algorithm wih Fast Fourier Transform) is based, these computations are efficient, with complexity O ( L 2logL ).},

Examples include fisheries, forests, grazing ranges, irrigation systems, and groundwater basins. Empirical evidence, however, suggests that appropriators in common pool resources develop credible commitments in many cases without relying on external authorities. We present findings from a series of experiments exploring (1) covenants alone (both one-shot and repeated communication opportunities); (2) swords alone (repeated opportunities to sanction each other); and (3) covenants combined with an internal sword (one-shot communication followed by repeated opportunities to sanction each other).},

Previous research shows that very cooperative people sometimes get punished (``antisocial punishment'') or criticized (``do-gooder derogation'') in many cultures. Here, we used a public-goods game with punishment to test whether antisocial punishment is used as a means of competing to be chosen by suppressing others' cooperation. As predicted, there was more antisocial punishment when participants were competing to be chosen for a subsequent cooperative task (a trust game) than without a subsequent task. This difference in antisocial punishment cannot be explained by differences in contributions, moralistic punishment, or confusion. This suggests that antisocial punishment is a social strategy that low cooperators use to avoid looking bad when high cooperators escalate cooperation.},

However, this conclusion relies on the assumption that benefits from mutualisms never stop increasing. Furthermore, almost all theoretical work focuses on the internal (asymptotic) stability of communities assembled all at once. Here, we present a model with saturating benefits from mutualisms and sequentially assembled communities. We show that such communities are internally stable for any level of diversity and any combination of species interaction types. External stability, or resistance to invasion, is thus an important but overlooked measure of stability. We demonstrate that the balance of different interaction types governs community dynamics. A higher fraction of mutualistic interactions can increase the external stability and diversity of communities as well as species persistence, if mutualistic interactions tend to provide unique benefits. Ecological selection increases the prevalence of mutualisms, and limits on biodiversity emerge from species interactions. Our results help resolve long-standing debates on the stability, saturation and diversity of communities.},

It has been suggested that costly punishment can promote the evolution of cooperation, with the threat of punishment deterring free-riders. Recent experiments, however, have revealed the existence of 'antisocial' punishment, where non-cooperators punish cooperators. While various theoretical models find that punishment can promote the evolution of cooperation, these models a priori exclude the possibility of antisocial punishment. Here we extend the standard theory of optional public goods games to include the full set of punishment strategies. We find that punishment no longer increases cooperation, and that selection favours substantial levels of antisocial punishment for a wide range of parameters. Furthermore, we conduct behavioural experiments, showing results consistent with our model predictions. As opposed to an altruistic act that promotes cooperation, punishment is mostly a self-interested tool for protecting oneself against potential competitors.},

  abstract = {For many nonlinear physical systems, approximate solutions are pursued by conventional perturbation theory in powers of the nonlinear terms. Unfortunately, this often produces divergent asymptotic series, collectively dismissed by Abel as ``an invention of the devil.'' Although a lot of progress has been made on understanding the mathematics and physics behind this, new approaches are still called for. A related method, the self-consistent expansion (SCE), has been introduced by Schwartz and Edwards. Its basic idea is a rescaling of the zeroth-order system around which the solution is expanded, to achieve optimal results. While low-order SCEs have been remarkably successful in describing the dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems (e.g., the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation), its convergence properties have not been elucidated before. To address this issue we apply this technique to the canonical partition function of the classical harmonic oscillator with a quartic gx4 anharmonicity, for which perturbation theory's divergence is well-known. We obtain the Nth order SCE for the partition function, which is rigorously found to converge exponentially fast in N, and uniformly in g{$\geq$}0. We use our results to elucidate the relation between the SCE and the class of approaches based on the so-called ``order-dependent mapping.'' Moreover, we put the SCE to test against other methods that improve upon perturbation theory (Borel resummation, hyperasymptotics, Pad{\'e} approximants, and the Lanczos {$\tau$}-method), and find that it compares favorably with all of them for small g and dominates over them for large g. The SCE is shown to converge to the correct partition function for the double-well potential case, even when expanding around the local maximum. Our treatment is generalized to the case of many oscillators, as well as to any nonlinearity of the form g{\textbar}x{\textbar}q with q{$\geq$}0 and complex g. These results allow us to treat the Airy function, and to see the fingerprints of Stokes lines in the SCE.},

The old subject of perturbative renormalization has been revived by the use of powerful methods such as multiscale decompositions; precise estimates have been added to the initial theorems on finiteness of renormalized perturbation theory, with new results on its large order asymptotics. Furthermore, constructive field theory has reached one of its major goals, the mathematically rigorous construction of some renormalizable quantum field theories. For these models one can in particular investigate rigorously the phenomenon of asymptotic freedom, which plays a key role in our current understanding of the interaction among elementary particles. However, until this book, there has been no pedagogical synthesis of these new developments. Vincent Rivasseau, who has been actively involved in them, now describes them for a wider audience. There are, in fact, common concepts at the heart of the progress on perturbative and constructive techniques. Exploiting these similarities, the author uses perturbative renormalization, which is the more widely known and conceptually simpler of the two cases, to explain the less familiar but more mathematically meaningful constructive renormalization.Originally published in 1991.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

In this paper, we qualify this result theoretically, showing that in the presence of risk aversion, loss aversion, or type I error aversion, type I errors have a stronger effect on deterrence than type II errors. We test these predictions with two experimental studies in which participants choose whether to steal from other individuals, under alternative combinations of probabilities of judicial errors. The results indicate that both types of errors have a significant impact on deterrence. As predicted, type I errors have a stronger impact on deterrence than type II errors. This asymmetry is entirely explained by differences in the expected utility gains from crime, whereas nonexpected utility factors do not play a significant role.},

But available social science research suggests that manipulating criminal law rules within that system to achieve heightened deterrence effects generally will be ineffective. Potential offenders often do not know of the legal rules. Even if they do, they frequently are unable to bring this knowledge to bear in guiding their conduct, due to a variety of situational, social, or chemical factors. Even if they can, a rational analysis commonly puts the perceived benefits of crime greater than its perceived costs, due to a variety of criminal justice realities such as low punishment rates. These conclusions are reinforced by studies of crime rates following rule changes. Many show no change in deterrent effect. Those that purport to show a deterrent effect commonly have persuasive non-deterrence explanations, such as a change in incapacitative effect. The few studies that segregate deterrent and incapacitative effects tend to reinforce the conclusion that rule formulation has a deterrent effect only in those unusual situations in which the preconditions to deterrence exist. Even there, the deterrent effects are quite minor and unpredictable, hence inadequate grounds to influence criminal law rule making.},

  abstract = {Human cooperation in social dilemmas challenges researchers from various disciplines. Here we combine advances in experimental economics and evolutionary biology that separately have shown that costly punishment and reputation formation, respectively, induce cooperation in social dilemmas. The mechanisms of punishment and reputation, however, substantially differ in their means for `disciplining' non-cooperators. Direct punishment incurs salient costs for both the punisher and the punished, whereas reputation mechanisms discipline by withholding action, immediately saving costs for the `punisher'. Consequently, costly punishment may become extinct in environments in which effective reputation building---for example, through indirect reciprocity---provides a cheaper and powerful way to sustain cooperation. Unexpectedly, as we show here, punishment is maintained when a combination with reputation building is available, however, at a low level. Costly punishment acts are markedly reduced although not simply substituted by appreciating reputation. Indeed, the remaining punishment acts are concentrated on free-riders, who are most severely punished in the combination. When given a choice, subjects even prefer a combination of reputation building with costly punishment. The interaction between punishment and reputation building boosts cooperative efficiency. Because punishment and reputation building are omnipresent interacting forces in human societies, costly punishing should appear less destructive without losing its deterring force.},

Here, we predict the mutability of all positions in SARS-CoV-2 protein domains to forecast the appearance of unseen variants. Using sequence data from other coronaviruses, pre-existing to SARS-CoV-2, we build statistical models that do not only capture amino-acid conservation but more complex patterns resulting from epistasis. We show that these models are notably superior to conservation profiles in estimating the already observable SARS-CoV-2 variability. In the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, we observe that the predicted mutability correlates well with experimental measures of protein stability and that both are reliable mutability predictors (ROC AUC {\textasciitilde}0.8). Most interestingly, we observe an increasing agreement between our model and the observed variability as more data become available over time, proving the anticipatory capacity of our model. When combined with data concerning the immune response, our approach identifies positions where current variants of concern are highly overrepresented. These results could assist studies on viral evolution, future viral outbreaks and, in particular, guide the exploration and anticipation of potentially harmful future SARS-CoV-2 variants.},

Rohr et al. devised a conceptual approach to study interactions between species that emphasizes the role of network structure (see the Perspective by Pawar). Using the example of mutualistic networks of communities of plants and their pollinator species, they show how the structure of networks can determine the persistence of the interactions. Network structures and architectures observed in nature intrinsically match the most stable solution. This approach has promise for application to questions of ecological community stability under global change. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1253497; see also p. 383 In ecology, structural stability influences the range of perturbations mutualistic networks can withstand. [Also see Perspective by Pawar] In theoretical ecology, traditional studies based on dynamical stability and numerical simulations have not found a unified answer to the effect of network architecture on community persistence. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework based on the concept of structural stability to explain such a disparity of results. We investigated the range of conditions necessary for the stable coexistence of all species in mutualistic systems. We show that the apparently contradictory conclusions reached by previous studies arise as a consequence of overseeing either the necessary conditions for persistence or its dependence on model parameterization. We show that observed network architectures maximize the range of conditions for species coexistence. We discuss the applicability of structural stability to study other types of interspecific interactions.}

Here we show that stochastic punishment falls short of sustaining cooperation in the repeated public good game. As punishment noise increases, we find that contributions decrease and punishment efforts intensify, resulting in a \$45{\textbackslash}\%\$ drop in gains compared to a noiseless control. Moreover, we observe that uncertainty causes a rise in antisocial punishment, a mutually harmful behavior previously associated with societies with a weak rule of law.

The scaffold is often considered to play a lesser role than highly diverse, non-genome-encoded sites in controlling binding affinity and specificity. To gauge the impact of the scaffold, we carried out quantitative phage display experiments where we compare the response to selection for binding to four different targets of three different antibody libraries based on distinct scaffolds but harboring the same diversity at randomized sites. We first show that the response to selection of an antibody library may be captured by two measurable parameters. Second, we provide evidence that one of these parameters is determined by the degree of affinity maturation of the scaffold, affinity maturation being the process by which antibodies accumulate somatic mutations to evolve towards higher affinities during the natural immune response. In all cases, we find that libraries of antibodies built around maturated scaffolds have a lower response to selection to other arbitrary targets than libraries built around germline-based scaffolds. We thus propose that germline-encoded scaffolds have a higher selective potential than maturated ones as a consequence of a selection for this potential over the long-term evolution of germline antibody genes. Our results are a first step towards quantifying the evolutionary potential of biomolecules.},

The analogy with statistical physics also reveals that, contrary to a basic tenet of the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, the frequencies of adaptive and deleterious substitutions at steady state are equal. Finally, just as the free energy function quantitatively characterizes the balance between energy and entropy, a free fitness function provides an analytical expression for the balance between natural selection and stochastic drift.},

(b) On the threesheeted surface, {$\beta$} = 0 is not an isolated singularity; thus, there are infinitely many singularities. (c) The singularities have {\textpm} 270{$^\circ$} as asymptotic phase. We also show that the perturbation series is asymptotic uniformly in any sector {\textbar}arg{$\beta\vert$} {$<$} {\texttheta} with {\texttheta} {$<$}3{$\pi$}2. We extend these results to many dimensional oscillators and x2m perturbations. Finally, we study the Pad{\'e} approximants formed from the Rayleigh-Schr{\"o}dinger series. Since En({$\beta$}) has no singularities in the cut plane {\textbar}arg{$\beta\vert$} {$<\pi$} (using results of references [37, 38]), the Pad{\'e} approximants f[N,N+j] converge as N {$\rightarrow$} {$\infty$} for j fixed, and yield En. A numerical analysis of the Pad{\'e} approximants, studying the convergence to En({$\beta$}) is presented.},

We aimed to design the scenarios to reflect communication demands that student clinicians commonly encounter, that integrated process and content, and which students would perceive as authentic and relevant. Scenarios were based on data from focus groups with recent graduates and interviews with clinic tutors. The scenarios combined content (e.g. medical history) and process (e.g. questioning and relationship skills) at a level suitable for junior students. Students evaluated scenario-based materials and SP activities in a survey comprising Likert-scale and open-ended questions. Students rated the materials and SP activities positively; open-ended comments supported the ratings. Scenario-based materials and activities based on student-clinicians' experiences, were perceived as relevant, realistic, and useful for learning.

This relationship, however, is far from being straightforward: depending on their mutation rate, Darwinian populations can climb the closest fitness peak (survival of the fittest), settle in lower regions with higher mutational robustness (survival of the flattest), or fail to adapt altogether (error catastrophes). These bifurcations highlight that evolution does not necessarily drive populations "from lower peak to higher peak", as Wright imagined. The problem therefore remains: how exactly does a complex landscape topography constrain evolution, and can we predict where it will go next? Here I introduce a generalization of quasispecies theory which identifies metastable evolutionary states as minima of an effective potential. From this representation I derive a coarse-grained, Markov state model of evolution, which in turn forms a basis for evolutionary predictions across a wide range of mutation rates. Because the effective potential is related to the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian, my approach could stimulate fruitful interactions between evolutionary dynamics and quantum many-body theory},

  abstract = {Many systems across the sciences evolve through the interaction of multiplicative growth and diffusive transport. In the presence of disorder, these opposing forces can generate localized structures and bursty dynamics, a phenomenon known as ``intermittency'' in non-equilibrium physics and as ``punctuated equilibrium'' in evolutionary theory. This behaviour is difficult to forecast; in particular there is no general principle to locate the regions where the system will settle, how long it will stay there, or where it will jump next. Here I introduce a Markovian representation of growth-transport dynamics that closes these gaps. I show that any autonomous positive linear system can be mapped onto a generalization of the ``maximal entropy random walk'', a Markov process with non-local transition rates. From this transformation follow a characterization of localization islands as minima of an effective potential, a general scheme to coarse-grain the state space along the basins of attraction of these minima, and an entropic Lyapunov function. These results unify the concepts of linear intermittency and metastability, and provide a generally applicable method to reduce, and predict, the dynamics of disordered linear systems. Applications range from Zeld'dovich's parabolic Anderson model to Eigen's quasispecies model of molecular evolution.},

  abstract = {Natural selection works on variation in fitness, but how should we measure ``variation'' to predict the rate of future evolution? Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection provides the short-run answer: the instantaneous rate of growth of a population's mean fitness is its variance in fitness. This identity captures an important feature of the evolutionary process, but, because it does not specify how the variance itself evolves in time, it cannot be used to predict evolutionary dynamics in the long run. In this paper we reconsider the problem of computing evolutionary trajectories from limited statistical information. We identify the feature of fitness distributions which controls their late-time evolution: their (suitably defined) tail indices. We show that the location, scale and shape of the fitness distribution can be predicted far into the future from the measurement of this tail index at some initial time. Unlike the ``fitness waves'' studied in the literature, this pattern encompasses both positive and negative selection and is not restricted to rapidly adapting populations. Our results are well supported by numerical simulations, both from the Wright--Fisher model and from a less structured genetic algorithm.},

We obtain a closed-form formula for the ``critical degree'' (the number of creditors per bank below which an individual shock can propagate throughout the network), and relate failures distributions to network topologies, in particular scalefree ones. Our criterion for the onset of contagion turns out to be isomorphic to the condition for cooperation to evolve on graphs and social networks, as recently formulated in evolutionary game theory. This remarkable connection supports recent calls for a methodological rapprochement between finance and ecology.},

We show that solutions to this problem are approximately Gaussian. We discuss two applications of this result. In the context of dissipative dynamics, the equilibrium distribution of a Brownian particle confined in a strong external field is independent of the shape of the confining potential. We also derive an H-type theorem for evolutionary dynamics: The entropy of the (standardized) distribution of fitness of a population evolving under natural selection is eventually increasing in time.},

I argue that natural selection can be viewed as a coarsening phenomenon, similar to the growth of domain size in quenched magnets or to Ostwald ripening in alloys and emulsions. In particular, I show that the most remarkable features of coarsening---scaling and self-similarity---have strict equivalents in evolutionary dynamics. This analogy has three main virtues: it brings a set of well-developed mathematical tools to bear on evolutionary dynamics; it suggests new problems in theoretical evolution; and it provides coarsening physics with a new exactly soluble model.},

I show that another measure of reproductive success, Fisher's reproductive value, resolves the trade-off between fitness and robustness in the quasi-species regime of evolution: to forecast the motion of a population in genotype space, one should look for peaks in the (mutation-rate dependent) landscape of genotypic reproductive values---whether or not these peaks correspond to local fitness maxima or flat fitness plateaus. This new landscape picture turns quasi-species dynamics into an instance of non-equilibrium dynamics, in the physical sense of Markovian processes, potential landscapes, entropy production, etc.},

We formalize this statement by a ``second-law'' inequality displaying upward mobility and precariousness as thermodynamic conjugate variables. We estimate the time scale for the ``relaxation'' of the wealth distribution after a sudden change of the after-tax return on capital.

The evolutionary behavior of single species is intermittent. Also, large bursts of apparently simultaneous evolutionary activity require no external cause.

  abstract = {The current implementation of the Neo-Darwinian model of evolution typically assumes that the set of possible phenotypes is organized into a highly symmetric and regular space equipped with a notion of distance, for example, a Euclidean vector space. Recent computational work on a biophysical genotype--phenotype model based on the folding of RNA sequences into secondary structures suggests a rather different picture. If phenotypes are organized according to genetic accessibility, the resulting space lacks a metric and is formalized by an unfamiliar structure, known as a pre-topology. Patterns of phenotypic evolution---such as punctuation, irreversibility, modularity---result naturally from the properties of this space. The classical framework, however, addresses these patterns by exclusively invoking natural selection on suitably imposed fitness landscapes. We propose to extend the explanatory level for phenotypic evolution from fitness considerations alone to include the topological structure of phenotype space as induced by the genotype--phenotype map. We introduce the mathematical concepts and tools necessary to formalize the notion of accessibility pre-topology relative to which we can speak of continuity in the genotype--phenotype map and in evolutionary trajectories. We connect the factorization of a pre-topology into a product space with the notion of phenotypic character and derive a condition for factorization. Based on anecdotal evidence from the RNA model, we conjecture that this condition is not globally fulfilled, but rather confined to regions where the genotype--phenotype map is continuous. Equivalently, local regions of genotype space on which the map is discontinuous are associated with the loss of character autonomy. This is consistent with the importance of these regions for phenotypic innovation. The intention of the present paper is to offer a perspective, a framework to implement this perspective, and a few results illustrating how this framework can be put to work. The RNA case is used as an example throughout the text.},

  abstract = {Game theory provides a quantitative framework for analyzing the behavior of rational agents. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma in particular has become a standard model for studying cooperation and cheating, with cooperation often emerging as a robust outcome in evolving populations. Here we extend evolutionary game theory by allowing players' payoffs as well as their strategies to evolve in response to selection on heritable mutations. In nature, many organisms engage in mutually beneficial interactions and individuals may seek to change the ratio of risk to reward for cooperation by altering the resources they commit to cooperative interactions. To study this, we construct a general framework for the coevolution of strategies and payoffs in arbitrary iterated games. We show that, when there is a tradeoff between the benefits and costs of cooperation, coevolution often leads to a dramatic loss of cooperation in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. The collapse of cooperation is so extreme that the average payoff in a population can decline even as the potential reward for mutual cooperation increases. Depending upon the form of tradeoffs, evolution may even move away from the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game altogether. Our work offers a new perspective on the Prisoner's Dilemma and its predictions for cooperation in natural populations; and it provides a general framework to understand the coevolution of strategies and payoffs in iterated interactions.},

  abstract = {Recent work has revealed a new class of ``zero-determinant'' (ZD) strategies for iterated, two-player games. ZD strategies allow a player to unilaterally enforce a linear relationship between her score and her opponent's score, and thus to achieve an unusual degree of control over both players' long-term payoffs. Although originally conceived in the context of classical two-player game theory, ZD strategies also have consequences in evolving populations of players. Here, we explore the evolutionary prospects for ZD strategies in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD). Several recent studies have focused on the evolution of ``extortion strategies,'' a subset of ZD strategies, and have found them to be unsuccessful in populations. Nevertheless, we identify a different subset of ZD strategies, called ``generous ZD strategies,'' that forgive defecting opponents but nonetheless dominate in evolving populations. For all but the smallest population sizes, generous ZD strategies are not only robust to being replaced by other strategies but can selectively replace any noncooperative ZD strategy. Generous strategies can be generalized beyond the space of ZD strategies, and they remain robust to invasion. When evolution occurs on the full set of all IPD strategies, selection disproportionately favors these generous strategies. In some regimes, generous strategies outperform even the most successful of the well-known IPD strategies, including win-stay-lose-shift.},

  abstract = {Fluctuating environments are situations where the spatio-temporal stochasticity plays a significant role in the evolutionary dynamics. The study of the evolution of cooperation in these environments typically assumes a homogeneous, well mixed population, whose constituents are endowed with identical capabilities. In this paper, we generalize these results by developing a systematic study for the cooperation dynamics in fluctuating environments under the consideration of structured, heterogeneous populations with individual entities subjected to general behavioral rules. Considering complex network topologies, and a behavioral rule based on generalized reciprocity, we perform a detailed analysis of the effect of the underlying interaction structure on the evolutionary stability of cooperation. We find that, in the presence of environmental fluctuations, the cooperation dynamics can lead to the creation of multiple network components, each with distinct evolutionary properties. This is paralleled to the freezing state in the Random Energy Model. We utilize this result to examine the applicability of our generalized reciprocity behavioral rule in a variety of settings. We thereby show that the introduced rule leads to steady state cooperative behavior that is always greater than or equal to the one predicted by the evolutionary stability analysis of unconditional cooperation. As a consequence, the implementation of our results may go beyond explaining the evolution of cooperation. In particular, they can be directly applied in domains that deal with the development of artificial systems able to adequately mimic reality, such as reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {In the 70's, Robert May demonstrated that complexity creates instability in generic models of ecological networks having random interaction matrices A. Similar random matrix models have since been applied in many disciplines. Central to assessing stability is the ``circular law'' since it describes the eigenvalue distribution for an important class of random matrices A. However, despite widespread adoption, the ``circular law'' does not apply for ecological systems in which density-dependence operates (i.e., where a species growth is determined by its density). Instead one needs to study the far more complicated eigenvalue distribution of the community matrix S\,=\,DA, where D is a diagonal matrix of population equilibrium values. Here we obtain this eigenvalue distribution. We show that if the random matrix A is locally stable, the community matrix S\,=\,DA will also be locally stable, providing the system is feasible (i.e., all species have positive equilibria D\,{$>$}\,0). This helps explain why, unusually, nearly all feasible systems studied here are locally stable. Large complex systems may thus be even more fragile than May predicted, given the difficulty of assembling a feasible system. It was also found that the degree of stability, or resilience of a system, depended on the minimum equilibrium population.},

Equations for optimal sets of level shift parameters are presented. Attention is paid to the specific problems appearing if the zero order solution is not a single Slater determinant. A special formalism for multi-configurational perturbation theories is outlined. It is shown that divergent perturbation series, like that of an anharmonic oscillator, can be converted to a convergent series by an appropriate redefinition of the zero order Hamiltonian via level shifts. The possible use of effective one-particle energies in many-body perturbation theory is also discussed. Partitioning optimization in a constant denominator perturbation theory leads to second order correction familiar from connected moment expansion techniques. Ionization potentials, computed perturbatively, are found sensitive to the choice of partitioning, and ordinary approximations are improved upon level shift optimization.},

Special attention is paid, in particular, to the so-called Fokker-Planck potential, which has a particular property: the perturbation series for the ground-state energy vanishes to all orders in the coupling parameter, but the actual ground-state energy is positive and dominated by instanton configurations of the form exp(-a/g), where a is the instanton action. The instanton effects are most naturally taken into account within the modified Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions whose expansion leads to the generalized perturbative expansions (so-called resurgent expansions) for the energy eigenvalues of the Fokker-Planck potential. Until now, these resurgent expansions have been mainly applied for small values of coupling parameter g, while much less attention has been paid to the strong-coupling regime. In this contribution, we compare the energy values, obtained by directly resumming generalized Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions, to the strong-coupling expansion, for which we determine the first few expansion coefficients in powers of g-2/3. Detailed calculations are performed for a wide range of coupling parameters g and indicate a considerable overlap between the regions of validity of the weak-coupling resurgent series and of the strong-coupling expansion. Apart from the analysis of the energy spectrum of the Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian, we also briefly discuss the computation of its eigenfunctions. These eigenfunctions may be utilized for the numerical integration of the (single-particle) time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation and, hence, for studying the dynamical evolution of the wave packets in the double-well-like potentials.},

Recently, researchers in social and behavioral sciences have identified a puzzling phenomenon called ``antisocial punishment'': some people are willing to pay a cost to ``punish'' those who act in ways that benefit their shared social group. Interestingly, the expression of antisocial punishment behavior is regionally diverse and linked to the sociopsychological dimensions of local cultural values. In this review, we adopt an ecological perspective to examine why antisocial punishment might be an advantageous strategy for individuals in some socioeconomic contexts. Drawing from research in behavioral economics, personality and social psychology, anthropology, we discuss the proximate mechanisms of antisocial punishment operating at an individual level, and their consequences at the group and cultural levels. We also consider the evolutionary dynamics of antisocial punishment investigated with computer simulations. We argue that antisocial punishment is an expression of aggression, and is driven by competition for status. Our review elucidates the possible socioecological underpinnings of antisocial punishment, which may have widespread repercussions at a cultural level.

Some scenarios prefer to unite all these functions into one primordial system, as illustrated in the lipid world scenario, which is considered as a didactic example in detail. Experimentally produced chemical replicators grow parabolically owing to product inhibition. A selection consequence is survival of everybody. The chromatographized replicator model predicts that such replicators spreading on surfaces can be selected for higher replication rate because double strands are washed away slower than single strands from the surface. Analysis of real ribozymes suggests that the error threshold of replication is less severe by about one order of magnitude than thought previously. Surface-bound dynamics is predicted to play a crucial role also for exponential replicators: unlinked genes belonging to the same genome do not displace each other by competition, and efficient and accurate replicases can spread. The most efficient form of such useful population structure is encapsulation by reproducing vesicles. The stochastic corrector model shows how such a bag of genes can survive, and what the role of chromosome formation and intragenic recombination could be. Prebiotic and early evolution cannot be understood without the models of dynamics.},

  abstract = {Economic experiments have shown that punishment can increase public goods game contributions over time. However, the effectiveness of punishment is challenged by second-order free-riding and antisocial punishment. The latter implies that noncooperators punish cooperators, while the former implies unwillingness to shoulder the cost of punishment. Here, we extend the theory of cooperation in the spatial public goods game by considering four competing strategies, which are traditional cooperators and defectors, as well as cooperators who punish defectors and defectors who punish cooperators. We show that if the synergistic effects are high enough to sustain cooperation based on network reciprocity alone, antisocial punishment does not deter public cooperation. Conversely, if synergistic effects are low and punishment is actively needed to sustain cooperation, antisocial punishment does is viable, but only if the cost-to-fine ratio is low. If the costs are relatively high, cooperation again dominates as a result of spatial pattern formation. Counterintuitively, defectors who do not punish cooperators, and are thus effectively second-order free-riding on antisocial punishment, form an active layer around punishing cooperators, which protects them against defectors that punish cooperators. A stable three-strategy phase that is sustained by the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance is also possible via the same route. The microscopic mechanism behind the reported evolutionary outcomes can be explained by the comparison of invasion rates that determine the stability of subsystem solutions. Our results reveal an unlikely evolutionary escape from adverse effects of antisocial punishment, and they provide a rationale for why second-order free-riding is not always an impediment to the evolutionary stability of punishment.},

To address the convergence properties directly, we explore perturbative corrections up to 30th order and highlight the role of the partitioning for convergence. The use of a simple Hartree--Fock solution for the unperturbed basis leads to a convergent MBPT series for soft interactions, in contrast to the divergent MBPT series obtained with a harmonic oscillator basis. For larger model spaces and heavier nuclei, where a direct high-order MBPT calculation is not feasible, we perform third-order calculations and compare to advanced ab initio coupled-cluster results for the same interactions and model spaces. We demonstrate that third-order MBPT provides ground-state energies for nuclei up into the tin isotopic chain in excellent agreement with the best available coupled-cluster calculations at a fraction of the computational cost.},

How can one effectively cope with noise in social dilemmas, situations in which self-interest and collective interests are conflicting? Consistent with hypotheses, the present research revealed that incidents of noise exert a detrimental effect on level of cooperation when a partner follows strict reciprocity (i.e., tit for tat) but that this effect can be overcome if a partner behaves somewhat more cooperatively than the actor did in the previous interaction (i.e., tit for tat plus 1). Also, when noise was present, tit for tat plus 1 elicited greater levels of cooperation than did tit for tat, thereby underscoring the benefits of adding generosity to reciprocity in coping with noise in social dilemmas.

Mach., 12 (1965), pp. 547--560], which we accordingly call Anderson acceleration here. This method has enjoyed considerable success and wide usage in electronic structure computations, where it is known as Anderson mixing; however, it seems to have been untried or underexploited in many other important applications. Moreover, while other acceleration methods have been extensively studied by the mathematics and numerical analysis communities, this method has received relatively little attention from these communities over the years. A recent paper by H. Fang and Y. Saad [Numer. Linear Algebra Appl., 16 (2009), pp. 197--221] has clarified a remarkable relationship of Anderson acceleration to quasi-Newton (secant updating) methods and extended it to define a broader Anderson family of acceleration methods. In this paper, our goals are to shed additional light on Anderson acceleration and to draw further attention to its usefulness as a general tool. We first show that, on linear problems, Anderson acceleration without truncation is ``essentially equivalent'' in a certain sense to the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method. We also show that the Type 1 variant in the Fang--Saad Anderson family is similarly essentially equivalent to the Arnoldi (full orthogonalization) method. We then discuss practical considerations for implementing Anderson acceleration and illustrate its performance through numerical experiments involving a variety of applications.},

The study finds that while some subjects are willing to reward and sanction others at a personal cost, the opportunity to reward or sanction is ineffective in facilitating cooperation relative to previous experiments in which a repeated game environment is employed. The study also compares behavior in an environment in which the imposition of rewards and sanctions is certain to an environment in which imposition is uncertain. The expected value of the reward or sanction is kept constant across environments to focus simply on the effect of uncertainty about imposition. Uncertainty does not change behavior in a significant way, either in the level of cooperation or the willingness of individuals to impose rewards or sanctions.},

The effect of size on physiology is, therefore, enormous and is typically expressed by how physiological phenomena scale with massb. When b = 1 a trait does not vary in direct proportion to mass and is said to scale allometrically. The study of allometric scaling goes back to at least the time of Galileo Galilei, and published scaling relationships are now available for hundreds of traits. Here, the methods of scaling analysis are reviewed, using examples for a range of traits with an emphasis on those related to metabolism in animals. Where necessary, new relationships have been generated from published data using modern phylogenetically informed techniques. During recent decades one of the most controversial scaling relationships has been that between metabolic rate and body mass and a number of explanations have been proposed for the scaling of this trait. Examples of these mechanistic explanations for metabolic scaling are reviewed, and suggestions made for comparing between them. Finally, the conceptual links between metabolic scaling and ecological patterns are examined, emphasizing the distinction between (1) the hypothesis that size- and temperature-dependent variation among species and individuals in metabolic rate influences ecological processes at levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere and (2) mechanistic explanations for metabolic rate that may explain the size- and temperaturedependence of this trait.

However, knowing the replication rate of each individual genotype may not suffice to predict the eventual survivor, even in an asexual population. According to quasi-species theory, selection favours the cloud of genotypes, interconnected by mutation, whose average replication rate is highest1,2,3,4,5. Here we confirm this prediction using digital organisms that self-replicate, mutate and evolve6,7,8,9. Forty pairs of populations were derived from 40 different ancestors in identical selective environments, except that one of each pair experienced a 4-fold higher mutation rate. In 12 cases, the dominant genotype that evolved at the lower mutation rate achieved a replication rate {$>$}1.5-fold faster than its counterpart. We allowed each of these disparate pairs to compete across a range of mutation rates. In each case, as mutation rate was increased, the~outcome of competition switched to favour the genotype with the lower replication rate. These genotypes, although they occupied lower fitness peaks, were located in flatter regions of the fitness surface and were therefore more robust with respect to mutations.},

  abstract = {Dynamics are introduced into Maynard Smith's game about the evolution of strategies in animal conflicts. The retaliator strategy is a weak attractor, but this is only a transient property because the game is structurally unstable. When the game is stabilised the retaliator becomes an evolutionarily stable strategy. At the same time another evolutionarily stable strategy appears comprising a mixture of hawks and bullies, and if individuals are allowed to play mixed strategies then this tends to produce a pecking order. Thus the stabilised game offers an explanation for the evolution of hierarchical societies in terms of natural selection acting on individuals.},

  abstract = {We consider the application of the type-I Anderson acceleration to solving general nonsmooth fixed-point problems. By interleaving with safeguarding steps and employing a Powell-type regularization and a restart checking for strong linear independence of the updates, we propose the first globally convergent variant of Anderson acceleration assuming only that the fixed-point iteration is nonexpansive. We show by extensive numerical experiments that many first order algorithms can be improved, especially in their terminal convergence, with the proposed algorithm. Our proposed method of acceleration is being implemented in SCS 2.1, one of the default solvers used in the convex optimization parser-solver CVXPY 1.0.},

  abstract = {We consider specific quantum mechanical model problems for which perturbation theory fails to explain physical properties like the eigenvalue spectrum even qualitatively, even if the asymptotic perturbation series is augmented by resummation prescriptions to ``cure'' the divergence in large orders of perturbation theory. Generalizations of perturbation theory are necessary, which include instanton configurations, characterized by non-analytic factors exp(-a/g) where a is a constant and g is the coupling. In the case of one-dimensional quantum mechanical potentials with two or more degenerate minima, the energy levels may be represented as an infinite sum of terms each of which involves a certain power of a non-analytic factor and represents itself an infinite divergent series. We attempt to provide a unified representation of related derivations previously found scattered in the literature. For the considered quantum mechanical problems, we discuss the derivation of the instanton contributions from a semi-classical calculation of the corresponding partition function in the path integral formalism. We also explain the relation with the corresponding WKB expansion of the solutions of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation, or alternatively of the Fredholm determinant det(H-E) (and some explicit calculations that verify this correspondence). We finally recall how these conjectures naturally emerge from a leading-order summation of multi-instanton contributions to the path integral representation of the partition function.},

  abstract = {In this review I present a method to estimate the large order behavior of perturbation theory in quantum mechanics and field theory. The basic idea, due to Lipatov, is to relate the large order behavior to (in general complex) instanton contributions to the path integral representation of Green's functions. I explain the method first in the case of a simple integral and of the anharmonic oscillator and recover the results of Bender and Wu. I apply it then to the {$\varphi$}4 field theory. I study general potentials and boson field theories. I show, following Parisi, how the method can be generalized to theories with fermions. Finally I outline the implications of these results for the summability of the series. In particular I explain a method to sum divergent series based on a Borel transformation. In a last section I compare the larger order behavior predictions to actual series calculation. I present also some numerical examples of series summation.},
