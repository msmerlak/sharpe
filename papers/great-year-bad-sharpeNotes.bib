@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note=" For instance: (1) Sharpe does not distinguish between upside and downside risk. (2) Short time series mean that the standard error on the Sharpe ratio is often comparable to its value. (3) Large tail risks can easily be concealed behind the veil of low volatility (hence high Sharpe), e.g. using short out-of-the-money options. "}
